=head1 NAME

Acme::Bitfield - Bitmask for Tracking Boolean Sets

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::Bitfield;

    my $bf = Acme::Bitfield->new( size => 100 );

    # Mark item 42 as present
    $bf->set( 42 );

    # Check if we have item 42
    say 'Found it!' if $bf->get(42);

    # Statistics
    printf "Progress: %.2f%%\r", ($bf->count / $bf->size * 100);

    # Export raw binary for network transfer
    my $raw = $bf->data;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Acme::Bitfield> provides a compact way to track a large set of big endian boolean flags. It is specifically designed
to follow the BitTorrent (BEP 03) bit-ordering convention, where the most significant bit of the first byte represents
index 0.

=head2 Bit Ordering

* Byte 0, Bit 0 (0x80) -> Index 0 * Byte 0, Bit 7 (0x01) -> Index 7 * Byte 1, Bit 0 (0x80) -> Index 8

This is the inverse of Perl's internal C<vec> bit-ordering, and this module handles the necessary bit-swizzling
transparently.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<get( $index )>

Returns 1 if the bit at C<$index> is set, 0 otherwise.

=head2 C<set( $index )>

Sets the bit at C<$index> to 1.

=head2 C<clear( $index )>

Sets the bit at C<$index> to 0.

=head2 C<count( )>

Returns the total number of bits set to 1.

=head2 C<size( )>

Returns the total capacity of the bitfield.

=head2 C<data( )>

Returns the raw binary string representation of the bitfield.

=head2 C<fill( )>

Sets all bits within the C<size> to 1.

=head2 C<find_missing( )>

Returns the index of the first bit set to 0, or C<undef> if all bits are set.
